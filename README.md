# Bookmark Tab

You can view your bookmarks on the new tab page of your browser, and easily rearrange them, move them to a new folder, or delete them using drag and drop. Additionally, the new tab page also offers real-time weather updates. With location permissions enabled, it will automatically present you with the local forecast. Manage your bookmarks and access the weather forecast efficiently with this powerful yet simple tool.

## Main Features
- Easy Bookmark Management: Drag and drop to organize, move, or delete bookmarks quickly.
- Weather Updates: Get the forecast on your new tab page. You can turn off/on this feature from the option page.

## Permissions
- Bookmark Data: We collect information related to the bookmarks you save. This data is processed solely on your device.
